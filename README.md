# Thematic lists of names

This is a collection of thematic word lists that you could use to name a dozen servers or a few hundred files. The first of these lists were created to name cities in a game, and I think they could be useful in scripts that generate texts. There may be other use cases I've never heard of. I prefer lists that are ordered naturally, e.g. by size, so that you don't have to use alphabetical order every time. Most of these lists contain some diacritics and special characters; it's an international collection. Besides general comments at the top, names are not explained, so you can copy a whole list at once, and use it to assign names automatically.

Themes to be added later: books of the Bible, human genes (very long list), minerals, biological species in various categories (difficult if you don't want to use the Latin names). If you want to add a list, please make a pull request with the new file. I will add the description here.

## History

This collection wasn't started in an office. Do you remember playing **Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri**? One of the things that made it an epic game was the characters of the faction leaders, *divided not by nationality, but by ideology*. The city names, on the other hand, were not as distinctive. It felt like they were all created by a 19th-century poet. Besides, I needed more names on big maps. So I created my own city names, using semantic domains that seemed suitable for each faction.

The **themes** folder contains the thematic lists in plain text, plus some comments at the start of the file. See the **basenames** folder [in the original *namenlijsten* repo](https://github.com/ProkhorZ/namenlijsten) for the faction files that you'd put in the Alpha Centauri folder. Those lists were a mixture of Dutch and English. This repo is going to be a general collection of thematic word lists in English, not limited to Alpha Centauri factions.

## Other collections

I started this collection before I knew the term '[naming scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network_naming_scheme)'. So I'm not sure whether I know all the relevant sources. Many lists in the collections I found contain explanations and comments, so you can't use them to assign names automatically.
