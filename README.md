# Thematic lists of names

This is a collection of thematic word lists that you could use to name a dozen servers or a few hundred files. The first of these lists were created to name cities in a game, and I think they could be useful in scripts that generate texts. There may be other use cases I've never heard of. I prefer lists that are ordered naturally, e.g. by size, so that you don't have to use alphabetical order every time. Most of these lists contain some diacritics and special characters; it's an international collection. Besides general comments at the top, names are not explained, so you can copy a whole list at once, and use it to assign names automatically.

Themes to be added later: Moons of the solar system, minerals, Shakespeare characters, Quran chapters, members of the Académie française, winners of the Fields Medal, more Nobel Prize winners, ancient kings and emperors, human genes (very long list). If you want to add a list, please make a pull request with the new file. I will add the description here. It should be a canonical or comprehensive list representing significant cultural heritage or natural phenomena - not just one person's favorites. I try to represent cultures from across the world, while focusing on Latin text for technical reasons.

## History

This collection wasn't started in an office. Do you remember playing **Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri**? One of the things that made it an epic game was the characters of the faction leaders, *divided not by nationality, but by ideology*. The city names, on the other hand, were not as distinctive. It felt like they were all created by a 19th-century poet. Besides, I needed more names on big maps. So I created my own city names, using semantic domains that seemed suitable for each faction.

The **themes** folder contains the thematic lists in plain text, plus some comments at the start of the file. See the **basenames** folder [in the original *namenlijsten* repo](https://github.com/ProkhorZ/namenlijsten) for the faction files that you'd put in the Alpha Centauri folder. Those lists were a mixture of Dutch and English. This repo is a general collection of thematic word lists in English, not limited to Alpha Centauri factions.

In 2017, cryptocurrencies securing their own blockchain and other tokens were listed separately, but this distinction isn't so clear anymore, and providers of market cap statistics don't separate their rankings into coins and tokens anymore. I'll keep the lists from 2017 for historical interest, and I'll add a new list of crypoassets in general.

## Other collections

I started this collection before I knew the term '[naming scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network_naming_scheme)'. So I'm not sure whether I know all the relevant sources. Many lists in the collections I found contain explanations and comments, so you can't use them to assign names automatically.
